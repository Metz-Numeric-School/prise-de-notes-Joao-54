The Stanford prison experiment:

- **The Stanford Prison Experiment is a famous psychology study made by Dr. Philip Zimbardo in 1971.**

- ==The goal of this experiment is to see how people would behave when they were given roles of power or submission in a fake prison.==

- **Participants were college students who were randomly assigned their roles, either guards or prisoners, and it took place in the basement of Stanford University.**

- ==We could see that guards became more agressive, abusive and authoritarian while prisoners showed signs of extreme stress and passivity.==

- **The experiment was initially planned to last two weeks but it was stopped after just 6 days because of the extreme behavior of the students.**

- ==Dr.Zimbardo became so involved in the experiment that he failed to notice that it was going way too far, until an outsider pointed it to him.==
